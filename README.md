# femtools
A c++ toolkit for finite element tools

## Background
This project was created for the purpose of exploring finite element methods for scientific modeling. 
The main goal is to develop a library of routines for finite element computation. It should be adaptable
to many problems (illustrated through the samples directory).

##  Tools/Guidelines
- Builds will be managed with CMake.
- Development should avoid platform specific files (e.g., visual studio solution files, makefile, etc...)
